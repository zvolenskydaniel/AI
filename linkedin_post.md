# Starting a focused learning journey in Artificial Intelligence & Automation

Over the past years, I’ve been working extensively with network and infrastructure automation using Python and Ansible. As AI capabilities rapidly evolve, I decided to deepen my understanding of how AI can be practically integrated into real-world automation workflows.

I’ve started documenting my learning journey publicly on GitHub, focusing on:
- Python + AI integrations (OpenAI API, LangChain, LlamaIndex)
- Automation workflows
- Agent-based systems (CrewAI, AutoGen)

## Chapter 1: Python + AI Integration (Intro)
This chapter focuses on:
- understanding how modern LLM APIs work
- basic interaction patterns with AI models using Python
- prompt design fundamentals
- simple, practical examples that can be extended into automation use cases

My goal is not just to learn AI concepts, but to understand how they can be safely, effectively, and realistically applied in production-oriented environments.

I’ll be sharing updates as I progress. Feedback and discussion are always welcome.

When you post this:
- Add GitHub link in the first comment, not the post itself (LinkedIn boosts reach)
- Pin the post to your profile
- Update your LinkedIn About section later with:
> “Currently focusing on AI-driven automation and agent-based systems using Python.”


If you want, next step could be adding a Tech Stack section — that’s gold for recruiters.

# Chapter README Example (01-python-ai-integration/README.md)
```md
# Python + AI Integration

This chapter introduces the fundamentals of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into Python applications.

## Topics Covered
- How LLM APIs work
- Authentication and environment setup
- Prompt design fundamentals
- Working with structured outputs (JSON)
- Common pitfalls and best practices

## Goal
To build a solid foundation for using AI models as reliable components within automation and software systems.

# Linkedin About
```text
I’m a network automation engineer with a strong Python background, currently expanding my focus toward Artificial Intelligence and agent-based automation systems.

Over the past several years, I’ve worked on building and maintaining reliable automation solutions across networking and infrastructure environments. My experience spans Python development, REST APIs, Linux-based systems, CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure automation tooling.

As AI capabilities mature, my current focus is on understanding how AI can be practically, safely, and effectively integrated into real-world engineering workflows. Rather than treating AI as a standalone topic, I approach it as an extension of automation — augmenting existing systems with intelligent decision-making, analysis, and orchestration.

My ongoing learning and hands-on experiments include:
• Python-based AI integrations (OpenAI APIs)
• Prompt design and structured outputs
• Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
• LangChain and LlamaIndex
• Agent-based systems (CrewAI, AutoGen)
• AI-assisted automation use cases

I value pragmatic engineering, clear system design, and solutions that are maintainable in production environments. I believe AI should enhance engineering workflows — not replace engineering fundamentals.

I document my learning journey and practical experiments publicly on GitHub as part of continuous professional development.
