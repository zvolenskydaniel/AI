# Artificial Intelligence: Learning Path
This repository is part of my personal self-development journey focused on Artificial Intelligence and its practical use in real-world projects.

The main goal is to build a solid understanding of AI concepts and learn how to effectively leverage them in both personal and commercial automation solutions. The project emphasizes hands-on experimentation and practical integration rather than purely theoretical knowledge.

To follow the content, basic programming skills are expected, with Python being the primary language used throughout the project.

The repository is structured hierarchically, starting with fundamental concepts and gradually progressing toward more advanced topics such as AI integrations, automation workflows, and agent-based systems.

## Learning Path
1. [**Python + AI Integration**](https://github.com/zvolenskydaniel/AI/blob/main/01-python-ai-integration/README.md)
   - OpenAI API fundamentals
   - Prompt engineering basics
   - Structured outputs & validation
   - Error handling and safety considerations

2. [**LangChain & LlamaIndex**](https://github.com/zvolenskydaniel/AI/blob/main/02-langchain-llamaindex/README.md)
   - Chains, tools, and memory
   - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
   - Document indexing and querying
   - Modular AI pipelines
   - [Example: AI Assistant Using Python Libraries LlamaIndex and LangChain](https://github.com/zvolenskydaniel/AI/blob/main/02-langchain-llamaindex/ai_assistant_example.md)

3. **Automation & Agent-Based Systems**
   - Single-agent vs multi-agent design
   - CrewAI and AutoGen fundamentals
   - Task orchestration and delegation
   - Failure handling and observability

4. **Real-World Use Cases**
   - AI-assisted infrastructure analysis
   - Automation helpers for operations
   - Practical AI tooling for engineers
